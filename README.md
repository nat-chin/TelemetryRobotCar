## R&D branch to learn robotics related control

### My Movement System idea here
UP = Forward (RC)
OK = Brake = Hard Deceleration (reverse RC )
DOWN = Backward
LEFT RIGHT = Steer (We don't have steering system , so we can only employ unequating two motor speed)
holding any button = Acceleration (Modeled by RC charge equation)
Let the button go = Deceleration (Modeled by RC discharge equation)
